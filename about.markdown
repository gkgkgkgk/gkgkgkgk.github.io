Hi! My name is Gavri Kepets. I am currently studying to be an Electrical Engineer at Cooper Union. This blogs serves as a place where I can write about and document some of the projects I am working on. I am particularly interested in computer graphics and game development.

Please feel free to reach out with any feedback!
