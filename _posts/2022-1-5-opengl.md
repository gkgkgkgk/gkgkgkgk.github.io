## First Post in a While
This is my first post in a very long time- these past few months have been incredibly busy and absolutely amazing. 

 >Warning! I'm about to talk about myself and not graphics engines for this section (If you aren't interested click here). 

 My spring semester ended up being really busy, but I had the oppurtunity to work on some awesome projects. One cool project I built was for a graduate class on Natural Language Processing, where I built a neural network to generate movie scripts [(my report and code are here)](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE467-NLP/blob/main/RNN/NLP_Final_Report.pdf). This was a really fun project and I got some decent results out of it, and I plan on revisiting it one day to make it better and write another post about it.

 After the semester ended, I moved out to Seattle for the summer for an internship at Amazon. Interning at Amazon was an excllent experience; everyone on my team was super kind and helpful, and I got to work on a fun, useful project.

 Living out in Seattle was also a great experience; I met a lot of new friends there and had the oppurtunity to go on some beautiful hikes.
