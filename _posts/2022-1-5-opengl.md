## First Post in a While
This is my first post in a very long time- these past few months have been incredibly busy and absolutely amazing. 

 >Warning! I'm about to talk about myself and not graphics engines for this section (If you aren't interested click [here](https://gkgkgkgk.github.io/graphics/2022/09/07/opengl.html#getting-started-with-opengl)). 

 My spring semester ended up being really busy, but I had the oppurtunity to work on some awesome projects. One cool project I built was for a graduate class on Natural Language Processing, where I built a neural network to generate movie scripts [(my report and code are here)](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE467-NLP/blob/main/RNN/NLP_Final_Report.pdf). This was a really fun project and I got some decent results out of it, and I plan on revisiting it one day to make it better and write another post about it.

 After the semester ended, I moved out to Seattle for a summer internship at Amazon. Interning at Amazon was an excellent experience; everyone on my team was super kind and helpful, and I got to work on a fun, meaningful project.

Living out in Seattle was also a great experience; I met a lot of new friends there and had the opportunity to go on some beautiful hikes.

Because of the busy spring semester and summer, and was working at a much slower rate on some of my personal projects. Additionally, this project happens to be much bigger than my other posts, and also had a difficult learning curve. My aim of this post is to discuss what I learned and make it easier for other people to learn it as well.

## Getting started with OpenGL
#### *The "real stuff" starts here*
For the past few months, I had been playing around with the idea of learning OpenGL. I've always been interested in computer graphics; I spend a lot of my time developing games (I never complete them, so I end up focusing on specific mechanics), so I naturally gravitated towards the lower level workings of the games I was building. I spent sometime learning how to use graphics shaders, how to 3D model and animate, as well as some procedural mesh generation (primarily for terrain generation, but also seen in my [quadtrees post](https://gkgkgkgk.github.io/unity/2021/11/17/quadtrees.html)). Finally, I decided to focus on learning OpenGL. I spent a few months on and off learning OpenGL, and if you are struggling with it too, I get it- it is *not* easy to get into. My end goal of this project is to build a simple voxel engine. I don't think I realized that adding the word "simple" before "voxel engine" wouldn't make it any easier.

### The Environment
> If you only care about the technical part of the post, you can skip this section!

This part of the post may not be so interesting, but if you are looking to work with OpenGL and are lost on how to start, I will outline the environment I am using to work with OpenGL. I am on Windows 10, and I am using WSL2 to develop all my code on Linux. I am using [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) to be able to run a graphics interface on WSL. Here are the steps to get that working:

 1. Install and configure WSL2
 2. Download VcXsrv
 3. Open WSL2 and run the following commands: 
	 `export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0`,
	`displayAddr=$(grep 'nameserver ' /etc/resolv.conf | cut -d\  -f2)`,
	`export DISPLAY=$displayAddr:0.0`
	This will allow WSL2 to use VcXsrv as a display.

Finally, in terms of the project layout, I have the following structure:

 - :file_folder: engine
	 - :file_folder: shaders
	 - :page_facing_up: main.cpp 
 - :file_folder: depends
 - :page_facing_up: CMakeLists.txt

in the engine folder, I have a shaders folder, where I keep a basic fragment and vertex shader. I also have the main file, and the rest of the code, which I will get into later.

The depends folder is all of my dependencies. I clone those from github directly into the folder, which github will treat as a submodule. For my project, I used [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew), [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [glm](https://github.com/Groovounet/glm), and [glut](https://github.com/markkilgard/glut). 

Finally, to run the project, I build with CMake, and it generates an executable. You can check out the exact code on my github [here]()!
