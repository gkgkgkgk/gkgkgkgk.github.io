## First Post in a While
This is my first post in a very long time. These past few months have been incredibly busy and absolutely amazing.

 My spring semester ended up being incredibly busy, but I had the oppurtunity to work on some awesome projects. One cool project I built was in a graduate class on Natural Language Processing, where I built a neural network to generate movie scripts [(my report and code are here)](https://github.com/gkgkgkgk/ECE467-NLP/blob/main/RNN/NLP_Final_Report.pdf).
